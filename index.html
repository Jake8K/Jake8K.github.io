                    <h1>The Strava (V3) API</h1>
                    <h5><a href=https://strava.github.io/api/>Strava's API Documentation</a></h5>
                    </br>
                    <h3>What's a Strava and why code for it?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Strava is perhaps the most popular athlete application today. Athletes in all walks of life and in all platform ecosystems have access to it. Whether you’re a triathlete or a swimmer, cycler, or runner. Whether you’re a Garmin, Suunto, Polar, or even just a casual runner with a phone. Strava can import your workout data or track it for you (fortunately for most, Garmin and Strava have a close relationship these days). It makes it easy to track your progress and compete with friends, even join groups and clubs of people in your sport(s).  If you have a premium account, then you have access to even more data metrics, including proprietary Strava metrics like their infamous “suffer score”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      What if you want to make an Application that uses that data, or if you simply want a way to read and interpret certain Strava metrics for your own personal pleasures? Then you’re going to head over to their API documentation to figure out how to write your JavaScript code for that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Strava’s API documentation is a great resource, especially if your application relies on jQuery. Unfortunately it is a little vague when it comes to Ajax calls. It also doesn’t explain the methods of authorizing a Strava user and retrieving that user’s access token. Additionally, because of the constraints imposed by CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing), the browser is prevented from making an Ajax request to a server on a different domain. As a result, we won’t be able to demonstrate the Authorization token exchange, but we’ll go over the basic code anyways. Unfortunately that also means that we’re stuck with my lazy account for the duration of this Strava API coding experience. We also won’t go into POST requests for the same reason, but they’re fairly similar to GETs.
                    </p>
                  </br>
                  <p>
                    Before we get started, the first thing you’re going to want to do is login to strava and get yourself a <a href="https://www.strava.com/settings/api">developer account</a>. Strava will then provide you with your app's client id and client secret. This should go without saying, but that secret is for your eyes only. You will also be awarded your first user access token (for yourself). Make sure to keep your client id, user id, and access token available for later.
                  </p>
                    <!-- <p><strong>Usage Instructions:</strong> Make sure to include the <code>scrolling-nav.js</code>,
                      <code>jquery.easing.min.js</code>, and <code>scrolling-nav.css</code> files. To make a link smooth
                      scroll to another section on the page, give the link the <code>.page-scroll</code> class and set the
                      link target to a corresponding ID on the page.</p> -->

                  <h3>What's an API?</h3>
                  <p class="leftText">
                    An <b>application program interface (API)</b> is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.
                    Read more about an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API</a>

                  <h3>What is Ajax?</h3>
                  <p class="leftText">
                    AJAX stands for <b>Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</b>. It’s basically the use of the XMLHttpRequest object to communicate with server-side scripts. It can send as well as receive information in a variety of formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and even text files. We’re going to be using JSON objects, the most commonly implemented format.
                    Read more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a>
                  </p>
                  <h3>What's a Request?</h3>
                  <p>The Strava API allows GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, and DELETE requests.</p>
                  <div class="leftText">
                    <li><b>GET Request Method:</b></br>
                      <p class="tab"> The GET request method requests a representation of the specified resource. GET requests retrieve data and (should) have no other effect. The URL’s query sting  (of the GET request) can include parameters to narrow down or define the element of interest.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>POST Request Method:</b>
                      <p class="tab">The POST request method requests that a server accept data enclosed in the body of the request message. Oftentimes this is a form or a file.  Usually this protocol is employed to store data on that server, whether it’s a Facebook post or a workout upload. As part of the POST request an arbitrary amount of data can be sent to the server in the body of the request message.</p>
                      </li>
                    <li><b>HEAD Request Method:</b>
                      <p class="tab">The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body. This is great for mining metadata.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>PUT Request Method:</b>
                      <p class="tab">The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied URI. If the URI refers to an already existing resource, it is modified; if the URI does not point to an existing resource, then the server can create the resource with that URI.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>DELETE Request Method:</b>
                      <p class="tab">Deletes the specified resource.</p>
                    </li>
                    <p>Read more about <a hre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods">HTTP requests</a></p>
                    <p>Strava’s request protocols employ HTTPS (as opposed to HTTP), which stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. Meaning that unlike http, all communications between the client (browser) and server is encrypted.</br>
                      We’re going to focus on GET requests because they’re the only ones we can test out right now.</p>

                  </br>
                  <p>
                    Lets back up a little and go over JSON objects briefly, in case you're not familiar with them yet.
                  </p>
                  <div class="leftText">
                    <p>Formally:</br>“JSON (<b>JavaScript Object Notation</b>) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999." – <a href= http://www.json.org>JSON.org</a></p>
                    <p>So, JSON objects are commonly used to pass information around especially in web applications. They're great because we can box up a lot of information and even include attributes of the information. They really can hold a lot of data (for an object) as we’ll see. The developer simply needs to create the object they want to send and pass it to the JSON built in function stringify. So JavaScript object foo is converted to JSON by JSON.stringify(foo). Then, on the receiving end we simply parse the string using JSON’s parse method and assign it to a new JavaScript variable, as in <code>var baz = JSON.parse(data)</code>. We’ll go over examples so you can understand why I used the generic data there to represent the response. Start your own research on application/JSON to learn more, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">Wikipedia</a> is great place to start. (as well as the official <a href= http://www.json.org>JSON.org</a> page, above).</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>For example, here is a Strava athlete's public data represented as a JSON object (left) and JavaScript object (right). Notice the striking similarity. Basically the only difference is the quotation marks around all the strings (hence JSON.stringify…).</p>

                              <h3>What the code on the left is saying, from the start is: </h3>
                              First, <code>myAppID</code> is your app ID (also known as client id) - this is the number given to you by
                              Strava when you set up your developer account and registered your app </br>
                              Next, your user ID for Strava. This is optinal since ideally your app will be using your users'
                              user IDs here. For testing purposes though, it's easy to use your account as a test case</br>
                              Third, <code>myAccountToken</code> is the access token. This is a long string of letters and numbers.
                              Strava will give you one to test with your app for your profile when you register your developer account.
                              This section will <code><b>authorize</b></code> is an object prototype for the sort of access token you want
                              to use. You don't have a lot of options here. <code>client_id</code> is provided to you by Strava for your
                              application, as we said. It's <code>myAppID</code>.Your <code>redirect_uri</code> is where you want the access token
                              to be sent so you can retrieve it from thequery string and save it. <code>scope</code> refers to what you want to
                              be able to do with the user's information. The authorization-section request you generate will refelct this.
                              <code>public</code> means that you just want access to their public information(no real permissios here)
                              <code>write</code> means that you want to POST to their account. This can be pictures, activity, whatever.
                              <code>view_private</code> means that you want access to all the data in their account, but you won't POST anything.
                              <code>view_private,write</code> means that you want full reading and writing privilages to their account. You can do anything.
                              <!-- <ul>
                                <li><code>public</code> means that you just want access to their public information(no real permissios here)</li>
                                <li><code>write</code> means that you want to POST to their account. This can be pictures, activity, whatever.</li>
                                <li><code>view_private</code> means that you want access to all the data in their account, but you won't POST anything.</li>
                                <li><code>view_private,write</code> means that you want full reading and writing privilages to their account. You can do anything.</li>
                              </ul> -->
                              Now, since POSTS require CORS access, as I mentioned earlier, we're only going to be requesting full read privilages.</br>
                              As with <code>authorize</code>, <code>athlete</code> represents our primary user and the information we wish to store.
                              Upon successful authorization of your app, Strava servers will return a JSON object with the user's information.
                              We'll store that here. </br>
                              <b>At last</b>, we're going to make the request. We bind this to our "activation" button in html and send an asynchronous
                              request to <code>https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize</code> with all of our variables from the authorization object we
                              created above. Notice how we used them to build a url address with GET request variables in the line starting with
                              <code>authReq.open...</code></br> If the request was successful, we get a JSON object containing our primary user's data.
                              We parse that JSON object into <code>authResponse</code> and use that to create an instance of an athlete named <code>mainUser</code>.
                              We pass the variables from the JSON athlete object back to our ahtlete constructor to take care of that for us.
                            </p>
                          </div>
                        </td>
                      </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p></br>
                      So what's the purpose of all of this code? Simple. You're going to send Strava something that looks like this:
                      <code>http://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=8080&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost/exchange_token&approval_prompt=force&scope=write</code>
                      </br>and if you're successfule, they're going to send you something that looks like this:
                      <code>http://localhost/exchange_token?state=&code=c498932e64136c8991a3fb31e3d1dfdf2f859357</code>
                      We're after this part, <code>c498932e64136c8991a3fb31e3d1dfdf2f859357</code>. The authorization token. It will be the first Element of the JSON object you'll receive, the second is the main user's athlete{..} object.</br></br>
                      I know thats a lot to process, but combine my example with the information provided by Strava and you should be in good shape.

                          <p>Lets go over what's happening here.</p>
                          <p>
                            First we are creating a new instance of an AJAX request object</br>
                            Then we specify the open member variable of the request object and specify that we are using the <code>GET</code> request protocol to access a resource specified by our <code>urlQuery</code> string. Finally true means that we are submitting an asynchronous type request. This allows us to account for errors, which in the Strava API case might be that the user revoked your applications access token and you no longer have access to that resource.</br>
                            To handle possible errors in transmission we add a function that will either parse the JSON object we receive, or communicate an error message.</br>
                            So, in light of that elucidation,  <code>if</code> we did not receive an error code, then we parse out our JSON object response string into a new object, which we will call response.</br>
                            To verify a successful request, we will print the object to the console.</br>
                            <code>else</code> if we were not successful,  we want to log the error code to the console to investigate what went wrong.</br>
                            Finally, we actually send the request.</br>
                          </p>
                        </div>

                    <h3>Examining our Response</h3>
                    <p>Recall from the previous section, we created a <code>response</code> object and assigned it the JavaScript (parsed) version of the response to our request. We printed it to the console, but that’s not really useful unless you’re just looking to read your own requests (in which case, you might as well just read your profile page, its much prettier and a lot less work).</p>
                    <p>If we did everything correctly in creating our request url and we’re authorized, we will probably get a response that looks like:</p>
                    <h4>Our response object</h4>
                    <iframe width="50%" height="400" src="//jsfiddle.net/jikarcz/rqmh69cp/embedded/js/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                    <p>Though obviously that's a pretty long piece of code, it coult be a lot longer. activity and athlete objects can be incredibly large</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3>Extracting what we want</h3>
                    <p>Obviously that’s a lot of data with a lot of null variables, ID numbers, and probably other junk we don’t care about.</p>
                    <p>Lets just save the name and time for each athlete, as well as their Strava user ID number in case we want to do something else with their profile later.</p>
                    <p>It’s easy to sift through the JavaScript object and select what we want, especially knowing what we know form the API documentation.</p>
                    <p>There are many ways to handle this, depending on what you want to do with it. You can take the response data and use it in an html file directly thought the DOM, you can simply save a singe item to a variable. To illustrate this though, lets just create an object and save the variables to it.</p>
